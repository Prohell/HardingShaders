## Installation

## Building for Windows
Clone the project.  Set the environment variable ARNOLD_PLUGIN_PATH to the location you would like the DLLs installed to.  If you will be using Maya, set the environment variable MTOA_TEMPLATES_PATH to the location you would like the template files to be copied.  Open the Visual Studio solution and build.  Check the console for errors copying files to their install locations.  The shaders should now be available to Kick and Maya.
